**Date:** Aug 10 - Dec 22, 2020  
**Author:** Tif Taylor + *Any listed Partners below that rotated for each challenge*

**About:**
This repo is set up for Code Fellows 301 and 401 course daily paired programming code challenges. Below is a list that notates the partner for that challenge and a link to the challenge code in this repo.

**Resources:**
- For the reduce challange, I evaluated and refactored my challenge code with [this guys file](https://gist.github.com/quangnd/572c6d410cb6512b7f252af0f2eb7cae) I found on google as a starting point. I did share my deduced result with the group per their request. 
- For the split reduce I talked with Matthew and used this [resource](https://dev.to/navi/comment/45bn) 
- For day 12 challenges I used [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39127989/creating-a-javascript-object-from-two-arrays) and my table mates.
- Used [MDN Page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes) for the string.includes() method
