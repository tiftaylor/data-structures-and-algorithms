# Implement Singly Linked List

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

CC05: Create a Node and Linked List class. Include methods for `insert`, `includes`, `toString`
CC06: Extend Linked List class - Include methods for `append`, `insertBefore`, `insertAfter`

## Approach & Efficiency

- Create Node and Linked List class 
- Build methods on the Linked List class to manipulate the LL
- When needing to iterate over the LL, it's best to use a while loop and reference the current node
- For specific insertions, do this by checking the value of the `next` property of the given current node

Big O:

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(n)
