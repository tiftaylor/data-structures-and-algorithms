# Implement: Stacks & Queues

<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge

Create classes `node`, `stack`, and `queue` that where the 2 latter had methods for pushing, popping, peeking nodes and to see if a stack or queue was empty. Write 14 tests to test. 

## Approach & Efficiency

- Created new node class just for the stacks and queues classes to use righta way
- Identified the similarities and differences between the methods for Stacks and Queues
- Used similiar code where I could with the exception of `top` and `front` for their respective classes
- Created if statements to catch exceptions

Big O:

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)
